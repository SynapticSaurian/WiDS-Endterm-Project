# WiDS 5.0 – Endterm Project  
## Building a Traffic Sign Classifier

This repository contains all the coding work completed as part of the WiDS 5.0
program, including assignments and the final project.

## Repository Structure
- **Week 3**
  - Assignment implementing basic machine learning concepts in Python.
- **Week 4**
  - Assignment focused on deep learning and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
    for traffic sign classification.
- **Week 5 – Final Project**
  - End-to-end implementation of a CNN-based traffic sign classifier using the
    German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset.
  - Includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and result analysis.

All code submissions are provided as Google Colab notebooks (`.ipynb`) with
saved outputs for reference. Tutorial or follow-along code from learning videos
has not been included.

## Weeks 1 & 2 (Background)
Weeks 1 and 2 focused on Python fundamentals, machine learning theory, and data
handling using Pandas. These weeks laid the conceptual foundation for the later
coding assignments and final project.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Google Colab / Kaggle
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
